Project 3
Author: Chenxi Liu (chenxil)

1. Features
   - Kd-tree with axis aligned bounding boxes.
   - Russian roulette sampling for refractive and reflective rays.
   - Glossy reflection.
   - Bilinear interpolation for texture.
   - (Depth of field implemented but deleted from the code, because of poor
     effect. See comments in trace_point function.)

2. Data Structure - Kd-tree
In this project, I chose kd-tree as the spatial data structure. Because kd-tree divides space along three coordinate planes, the relatively tight bounding boxes are rearrange to axis-aligned. By using AABBs, the time used to build kd-tree is reduced and it is more likely to divide bounding boxes into two areas. 
When building bounding box, a Mesh instance is treated as individual triangles. Each triangle has a bounding box. Although this decision may result in a large kd-tree, it actually saves time for rendering.
